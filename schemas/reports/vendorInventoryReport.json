Data is available at different date range aggregation levels: WEEK, MONTH, QUARTER, YEAR. Requests can span multiple date range periods. For example, if the customer specified reportPeriod=WEEK and a dataStartTime and dataEndTime that are 3 weeks apart, the report would contain data for each of those 3 contiguous weeks.",
