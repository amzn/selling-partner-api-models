# Selling Partner API Authentication/Authorization Library
This library provides helper classes for use when signing HTTP requests for Amazon Selling Partner APIs. It is intended for use
with the Selling Partner API Client Libraries generated by [openapi generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/)
using the Guzzlehttp library. It can also be integrated into custom projects.

## LWAAuthorizationSigner
Obtains and signs a request with an access token from LWA (Login with Amazon) for the specified endpoint using the provided LWA credentials.

*Example*
```
$lwaAuthorizationCredentials = new LWAAuthorizationCredentials([
"clientId" => '.....',
"clientSecret" => '.....',
"refreshToken" => '.....',
"endpoint" => 'https://api.amazon.com/auth/o2/token'
]);

// Initialize LWAAuthorizationSigner instance
$lwaAuthorizationSigner = new LWAAuthorizationSigner($lwaAuthorizationCredentials);
$config = new Configuration([], $lwaAuthorizationCredentials);

// Setting SP-API endpoint region. Change it according to the desired region
$config->setHost('https://sellingpartnerapi-na.amazon.com');

// Create a new HTTP client
$client = new GuzzleHttp\Client();

// Create an instance of the Orders Api client
$api = new OrdersApi($config, null, $client);
```

## LWAAccessTokenCache
Implements cache for access token that is returned in LWAClient and reuses the access token until time to live.

## RateLimitConfiguration
Interface to set and get rateLimit configurations that are used with RateLimiter. RateLimiter is used on client side to restrict the rate at which requests are made. RateLimitConfiguration takes a Permit, the rate at which requests are made, and TimeOut.

*Example*
```
$rateLimitOption = new RateLimitConfigurationOnRequests([
    "rateLimitToken" => "...",
    "rateLimitTokenLimit" => "...",
    "waitTimeOutInMilliSeconds" => "..."
]);
```


## Resources
This package features Mustache templates designed for use with [openapi generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/).
When you build Selling Partner API OpenAPI models with these templates, they help generate a rich SDK with functionality to invoke Selling Partner APIs built in. The templates are located in *resources/openapi-generator*.

Dependencies are declared in the composer.json file.
