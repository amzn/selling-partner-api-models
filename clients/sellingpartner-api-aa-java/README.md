# Selling Partner API Authentication/Authorization Library
This library provides helper classes for use when signing HTTP requests for Amazon Selling Partner APIs. It is intended for use
with the Selling Partner API Client Libraries generated by [swagger codegen](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/) 
using the OkHttp library. It can also be integrated into custom projects.

## LWAAuthorizationSigner
Obtains and signs a request with an access token from LWA (Login with Amazon) for the specified endpoint using the provided LWA credentials.

*Example*
```
com.squareup.okhttp.Request request = new Request.Builder()
    .url(...)
    ...
    .build();

// Seller APIs

LWAAuthorizationCredentials lwaAuthorizationCredentials = LWAAuthorizationCredentials.builder()
    .clientId("...")
    .clientSecret("...")
    .refreshToken("...")
    .endpoint("...")
    .build();

/* Sellerless APIs
The Selling Partner API scopes can be retrieved from the ScopeConstants class and passed as argument(s) to either the withScope(String scope) or withScopes(String... scopes) method during lwaAuthorizationCredentials object instantiation. */

import static com.amazon.SellingPartnerAPIAA.ScopeConstants.SCOPE_NOTIFICATIONS_API;

LWAAuthorizationCredentials lwaAuthorizationCredentials = LWAAuthorizationCredentials.builder()
    .clientId("...")
    .clientSecret("...")
    .withScopes("...")
    .endpoint("...")
    .build();

com.squareup.okhttp.Request signedRequest = new LWAAuthorizationSigner(lwaAuthorizationCredentials)
    .sign(request);
```

## AWSSigV4Signer
Signs a request with [AWS Signature Version 4](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html)
using the provided AWS developer account credentials. 

*Example*
```
com.squareup.okhttp.Request request = new Request.Builder()
    .url(...)
    ...
    .build();

AWSAuthenticationCredentials awsAuthenticationCredentials = AWSAuthenticationCredentials.builder()
                .accessKeyId("...")
                .secretKey("...")
                .region("...")
                .build();

com.squareup.okhttp.Request signedRequest = new AWSSigV4Signer(awsAuthenticationCredentials)
    .sign(request);

/*Signs request using IAM role credentials.

AWSAuthenticationCredentialsProvider awsAuthenticationCredentialsProvider = AWSAuthenticationCredentialsProvider.builder()
               .roleArn("...")
               .roleSessionName("...")
               .build();
               
com.squareup.okhttp.Request signedRequest = new 
     AWSSigV4Signer(awsAuthenticationCredentialsProvider.getCredentials())
    .sign(request);

```

## LWAAccessTokenCache
Interface to implement cache for access token that is returned in LWAClient and reuse the access token until time to live.


## Resources
This package features Mustache templates designed for use with [swagger codegen](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/). 
When you build Selling Partner API Swagger models with these templates, they help generate a rich SDK with functionality to invoke Selling Partner APIs built in. The templates are located in *resources/swagger-codegen*.
 
## Building
This library can be built using Maven by running this command in the package root:
 ```
mvn clean package
```
Dependencies are declared in the pom.xml file.
