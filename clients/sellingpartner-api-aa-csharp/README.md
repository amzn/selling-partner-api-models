# Selling Partner API Authentication/Authorization Library
This library provides helper classes for use when signing HTTP requests for Amazon Selling Partner APIs. It is intended for use
with the Selling Partner API Client Libraries generated by [swagger codegen](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/) 
using the RestSharp library. It can also be integrated into custom projects.

## LWAAuthorizationSigner
Obtains and signs a request with an access token from LWA (Login with Amazon) for the specified endpoint using the provided LWA credentials.

*Example*
```
using RestSharp;
using Amazon.SellingPartnerAPIAA;

string resource = "/my/api/path";
RestClient restClient = new RestClient("https://...");
IRestRequest restRequest = new RestRequest(resource, Method.GET);

// Seller APIs
LWAAuthorizationCredentials lwaAuthorizationCredentials = new LWAAuthorizationCredentials
{
    ClientId = "...",
    ClientSecret = "",
    RefreshToken = "",
    Endpoint = new Uri("...")
};

/* Sellerless APIs
The Selling Partner API scopes can be retrieved from the ScopeConstants class and used to specify a list of scopes of an LWAAuthorizationCredentials instance. */
LWAAuthorizationCredentials lwaAuthorizationCredentials = new LWAAuthorizationCredentials
{
    ClientId = "...",
    ClientSecret = "",
    Scopes = new List<string>() { ScopeConstants.ScopeNotificationsAPI, ScopeConstants.ScopeMigrationAPI }
    Endpoint = new Uri("...")
};

restRequest = new LWAAuthorizationSigner(lwaAuthorizationCredentials).Sign(restRequest);  
```
Note the IRestRequest reference is treated as **mutable** when signed.

## AWSSigV4Signer
Signs a request with [AWS Signature Version 4](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html)
using the provided AWS developer account credentials. 

*Example*
```
using RestSharp;
using Amazon.SellingPartnerAPIAA;

string resource = "/my/api/path";
RestClient restClient = new RestClient("https://...");
IRestRequest restRequest = new RestRequest(resource, Method.GET);

AWSAuthenticationCredentials awsAuthenticationCredentials = new AWSAuthenticationCredentials 
{
    AccessKeyId = "..."
    SecretKey = "..."
    Region = "..."
};

restRequest = new AWSSigV4Signer(awsAuthenticationCredentials)
    .Sign(restRequest, restClient.BaseUrl.Host);
```
Note the IRestRequest reference is treated as **mutable** when signed.

## RateLimitConfiguration

Interface to set and get rateLimit configurations that are used with RateLimiter. RateLimiter is used on client side to restrict the rate at which requests are made. RateLimiter Configuration takes Permit, rate which requests are made and TimeOut 


*Example*
```
RateLimitConfiguration rateLimitConfig = new RateLimitConfigurationOnRequests
            {
                RateLimitPermit = ..,
                WaitTimeOutInMilliSeconds = ...
            }; 

```

## Resources
This package features Mustache templates designed for use with [swagger codegen](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/). 
When you build Selling Partner API Swagger models with these templates, they help generate a rich SDK with functionality to invoke Selling Partner APIs built in. The templates are located in *resources/swagger-codegen*.
 
## Building
This package is built as a .NET Standard Library via a Visual Studio Solution with implementation and test projects.  The Visual Studio Community Edition can be obtained for free from Microsoft and used to build the solution and generate a .dll assembly which can be imported into other projects.

## Dependencies
All dependencies can be installed via NuGet
- RestSharp - 106.12.0 
- Newtonsoft.Json 12.0.3
- NETStandard.Library 2.0.3 (platform-specific implementation requirements are documented on the [Microsoft .NET Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard))
